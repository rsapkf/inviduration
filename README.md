## Inviduration

Inviduration shows total duration of playlists in [Invidio.us](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious) web app/instances.

Download from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/inviduration/).
Try the add-on [here](https://invidious.snopyta.org/playlist?list=PL3A5849BDE0581B19).

It currently works on these instances:

- [https://invidious.snopyta.org/](https://invidious.snopyta.org/)
- [https://invidious.kavin.rocks/](https://invidious.kavin.rocks/)
- [https://invidious.xyz/](https://invidious.xyz/)
- [https://yewtu.be/](https://yewtu.be/)
- [https://invidious.tube/](https://invidious.tube/)

**Note**: This add-on does not work for playlists with more than 100 videos because it queries the [Invidio.us API](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious/wiki/API) for lengths of videos. View [this issue](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious/issues/1260).
